This project contains:
* Backend: FastAPI (Python) with NumPy and Pandas
* Frontend: React with Vite
* Structured as two separate folders: backend/ and frontend/
This README includes setup instructions to run both independently in a local development environment.

### INSTALLATION GUIDE
* Install FASTAPI using pip install "fastapi[standard]"
* install NPM modules for react using the npm install or npm i command
* install numpy and pandas library for machine learning algorithm code to work

### USAGE GUIDE
* cd into the frontend directory and run npm run dev to start running the frontend at port 5173 (by default)
* cd into the backend and run the server.py python file to start backend at port number 5000

### DIRECTIONS
* backend/ml/logit.py source code for machine learning algo from scratcb
* backend/ml/model.py contains joblib code for loading machine learning model from the binary file
* backend/server.py contains the main backend code
* frontend/ contains all the code required for running the frontend
